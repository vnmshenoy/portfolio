 <h4><span class="myheader">Custom Database Diagrams - From existing Database</span></h4>
 <li>Earlier, we learnt how to Add Tables, Create relationship between tables etc. Now, imagine a scenario where you join a company and the product you are working on
 is already established. That means, database will be quite old and it will have many tables and relationship between tables. In order to understand
 the relationship between tables, database diagrams will be very handy
</li><br/><br/>
 <li>Let's consider, <b>Microsoft's Northwind Database</b> as an eg. If you donot have this database, you can download it from Microsoft's link which i have shared in my pill <b>Challenges in learning
</b>
</li><br/><br/>
 <li>Go to <b> Northwind Database</b>, select <b>Database Diagrams</b> and click on <b>New Database Diagram</b>. 
 You will get a popup like we saw earlier(in pill <b>Custom Database Diagrams-1 </b>). Selectin "OK" will create necessary Stored Procedures and tables in the database
</li><br/><br/>
<li>You can select multiple tables at once.Eg, I selected "Categories","Orders","Order Details","Prodcuts" and then clicked "Add". Doing
 so will automatically generate relationship between tables

</li><br/><br/>
<li>The links you see above are the relationships between the tables. You can click every link and check the relationship
</li><br/><br/>
</ul>
 <p class="pstyle">I reckon you will have <b>better understanding about database diagrams</b> now and will be able to use them more effectively in future</p>
