 <h4><span class="myheader">Custom Database Diagrams</span></h4>
 <li>Now let's create diagrams for our exsiting <b>Testing Database</b>. it has 2 tables to start with. Yeah,just 2 tables I want to keep it simple so that you can wrap your 
 head around it quickly.
 </li>
<li>Click on <b>new database diagram</b>. A new window will open and <b>Select the tables</b> (click <b>"Add"</b> button) you want to generate diagram for as shown in image<br/><br/>
                                <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/12AddTable.PNG" alt="add tables" />                        </li><br/><br/>
<li>This will create a diagram with the tables columns, primary keys and relationships that were read from the schema. 
You selected both the tables,and since this is completely new database, there are no relationship between the tables so you will see below <br/><br/>                            
    <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/14DBTableDiagram.PNG" alt="DBTableDiagram" />
</li><br/><br/>
<li>You can generate relationship between the tables. <b>Column "Id"</b> is the <b>Primary KEY</b> of both the tables.
 For eg, you can depict a relationship between <b>Customer table's Order id column (Foreign Key)</b> to the <b>id column</b>
 of the <b>Order table</b>. Simply drag line from Order id column to the ID column and doing so will popup a window like this. Press ok and relationship will be generated. The image on the
 right shows the relationship between the tables<br/><br/>

</li><br/><br/>
<li>You can <b> make it look smaller</b> by selecting all tables using control A and right click and then doing <b>"Autosize selected tables"</b> as shown in below image<br/><br/>
