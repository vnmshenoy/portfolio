 <h4><span class="myheader">Create back up of the database</span></h4>
                        <p class="pstyle">There are instances when you want to take the bakcup of the database. So lets assume we want to backup our <b>TestingDB</b>.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have just 2 tables ( <b>Customer</b> and <b>Order</b>) in my <b>Testing DB</b>. Nothing special about the tables in itself. 
                            It has few records ( 6 in each table ).Thats all.
                            <br> <br>

                            </li>
                            <li>Login to the Server using steps we saw earlier (Use Windows authentication)</li>
                            <li>Expand the server, expand Databases, select the database you want to take back up of. Right Click on the Database name. 
                            In this case <b>Testing DB</b></li>
                            <li>Click on <b>"Tasks"</b> and select back up as shown in image below <br> <br>
                                <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/4backup.PNG" alt="db backup" />  <br> <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>Now you are at the <b>"Back Up Database Screen"</b>. Database Backup Type can either be Full or Differential etc.In this case we will go with <b>"Full"</b>. 
                            In the <b>"Destination" option</b> Select <b>"Back up to" </b> as <b>"Disk" </b>(place where back up file will be stored).You can <b>click "Add" </b> that would open up 
                            <b> "Select Backup Destination" </b> prompt. On this prompt click the <b> 3 dots </b> on the right, which would take you to folder structure where you would want 
                            to save your .bak file. I chose <b>C:/temp </b> and named my filed <b>testingdb.bak</b> 
                            See below image for reference.

                            <br><br>						
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that above path we gave to save our backup file has proper read/write access for SQL Services
                            </li>
                            <li>Press OK on the 'Back Up Database' window and the database will begin backing up
                            </li>
                             <li>You will see a progress bar and when backup is completed, SSMS will notify you thorugh a prompt saying <b>'The backup of database [YouDBNAME]  completed successfully'</b></li>
                             <li>Go to the saved directory and you should see the backup file (in my case <b> testingdb.bak </b>)</li>                            
                        </ul>                        
                        <p class="pstyle">Congratulations... :-) you have created a back up file </p>
