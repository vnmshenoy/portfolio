              We have already discussed a quite a bit about Azure Durable
              Functions. I did write up on bit of history and why we need Azure
              Durable functions. You can read that article here..link below

              Microsoft's Azure has two great tools for creating a workflow. One
              is <b>Azure Logic Apps</b> and other is <b> Azure Functions</b>.
              Until recently, one could argue that Azure Functions were code
              triggered by events while Logic Apps were event-triggered
              workflows. However, after the release of Azure Durable Functions,
              things changed. Azure Durable Functions, a cloud implementation of
              the durable task framework, offers you a way to define a workflow
              using code and therefore I guess developers love it more since it
              offers more control to developers.Durable Functions is an
              extension of Azure Functions that allows you to add statefullness
              to otherwise stateless serverless applications. On the other
              hand,with Azure Logic Apps you can create stateful and serverless
              workflows through a visual designer and there is no need to write
              any code. If you are architecting a solution and you have to
              choose one of these two options, you might be wondering how to
              choose between Azure Durable Functions and Logic Apps. This blog
              of mine,tries to solve exactly that by comparing both platforms
              and therefore shedding some light that may help you better choose
              a platform that fits your needs
            </p>

                    Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets
                    you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly
                    provision or manage infrastructure. You can build Azure
                    Functions in various languages like C#, F#, Node.js &
                    Typescript, Python, Java and Powershell.

                    Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you schedule,
                    automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and
                    workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems,
                    and services across enterprises or organizations.

                    About a dozen built-in binding types(mainly for other Azure
                    services).<br />You can write custom code to create bindings
                    as per your need (If there isn’t an existing binding
                    available already). <br />There is lightweight but limited
                    configuration available within the Azure Portal. Unlike
                    Logic Apps there is no visual workflow designer
                    available.<br />Azure Functions do not have connectors. It
                    relies on triggers and input and output bindings – like
                    Event Hubs, Service Bus, Cosmos DB and Storage.
                    <br />Bindings in Azure Functions provide a way to connect
                    to data with code declaratively. List of bindings are very
                    much limited when you compare with Logic Apps

                    scenario where your application falls over when trying to
                    connect to third party system, then you should create the
                    logic yourself. There are no retry, resume or resubmit
                    capabilities, unless ofcourse your develop them yourself
                    using standard <b>try-catch</b> .With Azure Functions you do
                    not have the out-of-the-box retry capability like Logic Apps
                    except for Azure Queue and Blob Storage
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    Provide out of the box functionality with retries,scopes and
                    run after configuration. Incase you still have issues, you
                    can solve the problem by reviewing it in the azure portal,
                    looking for a workflow that gets a failed status and then
                    you can easily resubmit it.

              To conclude,I hope you would have got a better understanding on
              which platform to select when given a choice to architect your
              application. The platform better suited really depends on the
              functional and non-functional requirements and also on your
              preferences.The choice between the two is on how much control you
              need and how complex is your target solution.As a wrap up,we could
              say that <br /><b>Use Logic apps when:</b>
