            <h6>Monolith and Microservices</h6>
            <p>
              Originally, server-side applications were built in a style which
              is now referred to as <b>Monolith</b>. A monolithic application is
              built as a single unit.Enterprise Applications are built in three
              parts: a database (mostly relational database), a client-side user
              interface (HTML,Javascript on browser), and a server-side
              application(Eg C#,Java etc). This server-side application will
              handle HTTP requests, execute some business domain logic,
              retrieve/update data from/to database, and finally populate the
              HTML views to be sent back to the client's
              browser(Chrome,Firefox,IE etc). It is a monolith ‚Äì a single
              logical executable. To make any alterations to the system, a
              developer must build and deploy an updated version of the
              server-side application.If multiple people and teams were
              developing parts of the same application, they mostly contributed
              to the same code base.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the teams follow coding and design practises well, code base
              would be structured well and it would have some distinct modules
              or components, and a single team would typically own each
              module.Normally, the modules would be packaged together at build
              time and then deployed as a single unit, so a lot of interaction
              between modules would stay inside the OS process. Although the
              modules could stay loosely coupled, over a period of time, since
              all teams would use a single centralized database, the coupling
              almost always occurs on the level of the data store . This model
              works great for small- to medium-size applications, but as the
              team number swells,it turns out that teams start getting in each
              other‚Äôs way as synchronization of contributions takes more and
              more effort.<br />

              Monolith approach Eg in diagram below <br />
              <img
                border="0"
                src="DurableFunctionBasics/monolithapproach.jpg"
                alt="monolith"
              />
              <br />
              As an alternative, and as industry evolved, there was this new
              approach which came up with a revised service-oriented strategy
              commonly called <b>Microservices</b>. In this approach,teams split
              the big application into ‚Äúvertical slices‚Äù structured around the
              distinct business capabilities.Microservice capabilities are
              expressed formally with business-oriented APIs.Each microservice
              encapsulate a core business capability and the same service can be
              reused in more than one business processes(and thats the beauty if
              microservices) or over different business sceanrios, depending on
              the requirement. By ensuring that principles of loose coupling are
              followed and implemented, dependencies between services and their
              consumer are kept to minimal.Services talk to each other via
              documented and versioned public contracts.If microservices‚Äô
              interfaces are exposed with a standard protocol, such as a
              REST-ful API, they can be consumed and reused by other services
              and applications without direct coupling through language bindings
              or shared libraries. If the borders for the split were selected
              well‚Äîand that‚Äôs the most tricky part‚Äîthe contracts are standarized
              and stay stable over time, and thin enough to avoid too much
              chattiness then team can change the implementation of the
              service,and consumers wont be affected by changes .This gives each
              team enough autonomy to innovate at their best pace and to make
              independent technical decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In microservices approach,each team then owns a whole
              vertical‚Äîfrom communication contracts, or even UIs, down to the
              data storage. Explicitly shared databases are not recommended at
              all.There are few drawbacks of microservices as well.<br />
              <img
                border="0"
                src="DurableFunctionBasics/microservices.jpg"
                alt="microservices"
              /><br />
              The tradeoff of this flexibility is complexity. Managing a
              multitude of distributed services at scale is difficult for the
              following reasons:
            </p>
            <b>Trade offs:</b><br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">1).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Teams need to easily discover services as potential resuse
              candidates.We all know resuing services is easier than building
              from scratch, but for that to happen these services should be well
              documented etc.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">2).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Interdependencies between services need to be closely monitored.If
              not architectured well, an application based on microservices
              might end up being a distributed monolith. In such scenario,
              microservices are chatty, sometimes calling each other and
              defeating the main purpose.Changes to one microservice required
              changes to others(becomes highly coupled).
            </p>
            <h6 style="display: inline">3).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Services interact with each other through networks. Networks are
              fundamentally unreliable.They work fine most of the times,but when
              they fail it fails in all kinds of unpredictable manner.Yeah
              network sometime takes break üòä <br />
              <br />

              /><br /><br />
              Imagine a scenario when one service goes unhealthy and is down.It
              can go offline for multiple reasons, for instance say a new
              version of service is being deployed,or may be there are plenty of
              requests coming in and it cant handle the request load etc.The
              problem is that all the requests to this failed/down service start
              failing.The dependent service waits for the response and thus
              blocks incoming requests of its own.You can probably guess where
              it is heading.The error cascades upstream and there are failures
              all over the place.The application is down. Your manager ofcourse
              is not happy.

            <p>
              <img
                style="margin-left: 10%"

            </p>

            <p>
              In an event-driven microservice architecture, services communicate
              each-other via event messages. When a service performs some piece
              of work that other services might be interested in, that service
              produces an event. Other services consume them through event
              listeners and perform any of their own tasks.
            </p>
            <h4>How do APIs work?</h4>
            <p>
              So we already learnt above that an API- Application Programming
              Interface is a set of rules that define how computers,
              applications, or machines can talk to each other. You can think of
              it this way: the typical user interface is intended for use by a
              human being, while APIs are intended for use by an application or
              a computer or another software<br />
              <img
                src="apiandschema/api.jpeg"
                alt="api"
                class="img-fluid"
              /><br /><br />
              Most web APIs sit between the application and the web server. The
              human initiates an API call that tells the application to do
              something, then the application in turn will use an API to ask the
              web server to do something. The response returned by the web
              server is returned to the application which normally puts the
              details in a user friendly way i.e shown nicely on the front end
              so that the end user can read/understand <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Most Common Types of API</h4>
            <img
              src="apiandschema/soap_vs_rest.png"
              alt="api"

            /><br /><br />
            <ul style="display: inline">
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots" style="margin-top: -2%">
                <b>1 REST APIs)</b> - Stands for Representational State
                Transfer. <br />
                <img
                  src="apiandschema/restapi.jpg"
                  alt="api"

                /><br /><br />
                It is an architectural style. The
                <b>REST architecture</b> generally consists of clients, servers,
                resources, and a vocabulary of HTTP operations known as
                <b>request methods</b>. REST relies on principles that are
                ultimately simpler to follow than a prescribed protocol. Most of
                the API's specially Public API's use REST standard these days
                specifically because of its fast performance, reliability, and
                ability to scale by reusing modular components without affecting
                the system as a whole.<br />From developer point of view, REST
                is a set of rules that they need to follow when they create
                their API.<br />
                One of the rules states that you should be able to get a piece
                of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.<b
                  >Each URL</b
                >
                is called a <b>request</b> while the <b>data sent back</b> to
                you is called a <b>response</b>.<br />The <b>payload</b> - the
                data to be delivered (i.e the response) - will be
                <b>formatted in a language</b>
                such as <b>JSON</b>, or <b>XML</b>.<br />The
                <b>set of operations</b>
                are the methods available to HTTP, which is the underlying
                protocol for how browsers retrieve websites from servers. These
                methods include
                <b>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others</b>.<br />And thats why
                it's easier for developer because even if they don't know
                specifics of REST, they are likely to know how to work with
                RESTful APIs thanks to the underlying foundation upon which they
                are built: HTTP.<br /><br />

                  <b>URI (uniform resource identifier)</b>, which is the URL
                  address, also known as an ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù).The endpoint (or route)
                  is the url you request for. It follows this structure:
                  https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/
                  https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/. The root-endpoint is
                  the starting point of the API you‚Äôre requesting from. The
                  root-endpoint of Github‚Äôs API is https://api.github.com while

                This is more complex than REST because it requires more
                information upfront about security and how to sends messages.
                SOAP, unlike the REST pattern, supports the XML data format only
                and strongly follows preset standards such as messaging
                structure, a set of encoding rules, and a convention for
                providing procedure requests and responses and therefore to lack
                the lightweight portability and flexibility of REST.SOAP was
                developed to help standardize message formats and requests.SOAP
                API's are still used specially it can assist in certain
                scenarios better. For instance, if you need more robust
                security, SOAP‚Äôs support for WS-Security can come in handy. SOAP
                can be extended with WS standard protocols. Another advantage of
                SOAP is that it offers built-in retry logic to compensate for
                failed communications. REST, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt have a
                built-in messaging system. If a communication fails, the client
                has to deal with it by retrying. There‚Äôs also no standard set of
                rules for REST. SOAP is highly extensible through other
                protocols and technologies. In addition to WS-Security, SOAP
                supports WS-Addressing, WS-Coordination, WS-ReliableMessaging,
                and a lot of other web services standards. You can find full
