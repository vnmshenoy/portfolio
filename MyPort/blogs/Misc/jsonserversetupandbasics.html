            <p>
              In this blog we will learn about JSON Server,it's setup and how to
              use it.
            </p>
            <h4>What is JSON server</h4>
            <p>
              It is a <b>JavaScript JSON-Server library</b>, which can be used
              to create <b>fake REST API</b>. JSON Server is a great way to set
              up a <b>full fake REST API for front-end development</b>.The best
              part about the library is that it can be setup quickly and one can
              start using it in almost no time. You can use some of the real
              API’s data if it already exists or create a mock data based on the
              API Schema in db.json file
            </p>
            <h4>Why do we need to fake API's?</h4>
            <p>
              For any software to be successful and delivered on time, all
              teams(eg front end devs,backend devs,testers,UX etc) needs to work
              together and when possible parallely. During software development
              phase, front end developers are given a requirement for the things
              they need to work upon. For eg, they need to develop a new
              screen.The dynamic data which needs to be shown on the screen has
              to come from somewhere (may be from a DB,or 3rd party
              application,or any other data source in that matter). The point is
              front end needs to talk to the backend and get the data. Most of
              the modern web application expose REST API for the front end to
              consume. Now,when the new requirement comes in, front end
              developers can't wait for the API to be 100% ready before they can
              start developing the screen. Just imagine the time wasted.Also,
              even if the API is 100% ready, there are other reasons to use a
              FAKE API. eg What if the API is slow, or if API is a paid service
              and you will incur costs when you hit the API multiple times
              during development ,or api is rate-limited,or you are behind a
              firewall and can't make outbound calls. There may be other reasons
              as well. So having FAKE API's expedites the process of front end
              development. And once API is 100% ready and front end dev is
              actually done, you can replace the fake api call with the original
              API call before deploying it for testing phase

                To check if node is installed succesfully, or if node already

                It is db.json file which actually acts as the REST endpoint with

                  Use any REST API client like <b>Postman</b> to test out the

                    First one,shows what fields to select when pasting body into
                    JSON. (select <b>raw</b>, ad select type as <b>JSON</b>). It
                    also shows <b>id</b> which is
                    <b>value of 3 in this case</b> being passed in the URL

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Second one,shows how to set header(select
                    <b>content-type</b> as <b>application/json</b>)
                    <img

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Third one,actually shows you the response i.e actually after
                    you send the request to the API.)
                    <img
                      src="jsonserver/6PUTResponse.PNG"
                      alt="putres"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    /><br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If you again run a <b>GET</b> you will see the record with
                  <b
                    >id of 3 has been updated to the new value you sent above</b
                  >
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

                <h6>DELETE-Remove an existing record/employee</h6>
                <p>
                  You can delete a record by simply passing the value of id in
                  the URL and doing a DELETE as shown in image below
                </p>
                <img
                  src="jsonserver/7DELETE.PNG"
                  alt="delete"
                  class="img-fluid"
                /><br />
                <p>
                  If you again run a <b>GET</b> you will see the record with
                  <b>id of 4 has been deleted</b>
                </p>

                <h6>
                  If you donot want to use id but any other customid eg
                  <b>employeeid</b>
                </h6>
                <p>
                  If you notice below, we donot use an <b>id</b> but an
                  <b>employeeid</b> in our db.json. If you start json server
                  normally lole we did above, we will get an error.problem is
                  json-server use id as a primary key when you searching

                <h6>Fix for above issue</h6>
                <b>json-server db.json --id 'employeeid' </b>
                <p>
                  all should start working as normal again.Also point to
                  remember is that A J SON data needs a property named "id" to
                  store the data we send.(If already some data is stored
                  manually in the DB) If the DB is empty when we send our first
                  request, it will assign a parameter "id" automatically(and
                  give it some random value) in addition to the provided data
                  (if we don't mention an "id" parameter explicitly) and for
                  every further request.
