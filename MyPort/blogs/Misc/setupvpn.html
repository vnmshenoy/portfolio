              In this blog I will explain you how to set up OpenVPN on the
              router in your home or small office
            </p>
            <b> What we will achieve at the end of this blog</b>
            <p>
              At the end of this tutorial, we will see how to configure OpenVPN
              on your rotuer and therefore, how all devices connected to that
              local network can use the VPN
            </p>
            <p>
              You would have come across many articles which say how important
              it is to use VPN from security and Anonymity perspective.So,I
              won't dwell into that.Rather,I would just concentrate on the steps
              required to setup VPN on your router.
            </p>
            <p>
              For any average consumer, VPNs- Virtual Private Networks can be an
              excellent security aid,specially if you are running a small
              business. VPNs provide security to data in transit as they encrypt
              the data. The main question is how to achieve the privacy and
              security all the time at your home or office.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>One way</b> is to install separate VPN clients on all your
              devices as well as all those being used by your family or small
              business co-workers.But installing a separate client on a
              multitude of different devices is a pain and tiresome job.Also
              ensuring everyone connecting through VPN is also tough task.
              <b>Other way</b> is to configure your VPN on the router so that
              all the devices connected to it automatically will use VPN. With a
              VPN client on your router, anyone using your local network to
              browse the web or access a cloud service will automatically be
              using the VPN as it'll be running 24x7.This is the way we are
              discussing here.
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 0px">
              <b> Below are the steps one should follow</b>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Buy a router that supports <b>OpenVPN</b>
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Power on the router. Pretty basic but should not be missed
                &#128522;
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Your ISP-Internet Service Provider might have provided you with
                a Wi-Fi-modem. My ISP's network had SSID of say
                <b>BELONG-XXXX</b>. This was the network I used to connect to so
                far to connect to internet(without VPN). This Wi-Fi modem shall
                have an <b>Ethernet LAN port</b> that can be used to connect to
                the router’s (the one you bought) WAN port. You can connect your
                ISP's modem to router by cable directly
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="padding-left: 0px">
              <b
                >Now its time to connect your device(Windows,Android,iOS etc) to
                the router. You can connect to the router via Ethernet cable or
                Wi-Fi.I connected through Wi-Fi</b
              >

              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                To connect your device to the router,you can search for the
                <b>SSID </b> of the router.Enter UserName and Password as
                well(SSID,Username,Password must be available in router's
                documentation). My router's SSID started with
                <b>GL-XXXXX-XXX</b>.To access the <b>Web Admin panel</b> of the
                router I had to visit <b>http://192.168.8.1</b> Once logged in,
                you can view the router's Web Admin panel. Once connected, you
                can login to the web-based interface of the router.Once you
                succesfully log in, you will see the dashboard.I have added mine
                for reference only.Yours may look different obviously.

                  alt="Router Web Based Interface"
                /><br />
                <p>
                  <b>Note:</b> Look for the URL, Userid and the Password in the
                  router’s documentation itself
                </p>
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Now you should be able to connect your devices to the local area
                network (LAN) of the router. You <b>cannot</b> access the
                Internet currently
              </li>

              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Web Admin panel allows you to check the status and manage the
                settings of the router.Once in the admin panel, configure your
                router to access the internet so that it can talk to the outside
                world. To do so,I clicked on the <b>“repeater”</b> settings of
                the router. It takes an existing signal from a wireless router
                or wireless access poin and rebroadcasts it to create a second
                network. In Repeater section, click <b>Scan</b> to search for
                the available wireless networks nearby (in my case the original
                wireless network with SSID BELONG-XXX).Connect using user ISP’s
                username and password
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Doing above would ensure that your router is communicating with
                outside world and you connect to the Internet even if you are
                connecting to the SSID of the router
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              So far we have configured router to connect to existing Wi-Fi
              network.We havenot setup VPN yet. Now lets look how to setup
              vpn.All major VPN providers like ExpressVPN ,Cyberghost,Surfshark
              etc allow you to download <b>manual configuration</b> Download the
              <b>.ovpn file</b> from the manual configuration page of your VPN
              provider. Each Server location (in my case as I was trying to
              connect to <b>India-Mumbai</b>) had an .ovpn file download option.
              Download the file to your Deskptop and save it. <b>Note:</b> I
              have used both ExpressVPN and Surfshark and the process is more or
              less same.Am sure it is similar with other VPN providers as well.I
              in this case will use Surfshark just because I have that currently
              but that doesn’t stop you from using your favorite VPN provider.
            </p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 0px">
              <b>Steps to follow on VPN provider's website </b>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Buy a subscription. Most of them offer a trial period of 30 days
                or so which is excellent option to try out
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                I am taking an eg of SurfShark.Navigate to surfshark’s website
                <b
                  >https://support.surfshark.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001458953-Tutorial</b
                >
                This link is available at the time of download.Basically you
                need to search how to setup manual configuration irrespective of
                which provider you are using
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Since am using Windows laptop i follow the steps to download
                .opvn file for windows device.I downloaded both
                <b>.tcpovpn</b> and <b>.udpovpn</b> files UDP and TCP are
                protocols with their own pros and cons.I wont get into depth of
                it but I would say The OpenVPN UDP protocol is usually a little
                bit faster, while OpenVPN TCP is usually a little bit more
                stable.However, that is not always the case, therefore, we
                always suggest trying them both out and checking what works best
                for you.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Once you have downloaded this .opvn file, you will also have to
                copy paste service credential from surfsharks website as shown
                in img 4 below.Save these somewhere as you will need it soon

            </ul>
            <ul style="padding-left: 0px">
              <b> Now go back to the routers admin panel for final steps </b>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 2%">
                Look for <b>OpenVpn Client</b>. My router’s webadmin had below
                settings as shown in img 2

              <li style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 2%">
                Click on the <b>OpenVPN client</b> and you will see a page which
                asks you to add .ovpn file something like in img 3
                <img
                  src="../../img/openVPN/3img.png"
                  alt="VPN Service management"
                />
              </li>

              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Drop the .ovpn file you saved on your machine(the file you saved
                on desktop in our earlier steps).It will ask for name(eg
                mumbai_myvpnserver1) just for you to identify the server
                location quickly. It will also ask for server's username and
                password).Copy paste the username and password your got from
                your vpn providers website(in this case surfshark)
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 30px">
                Click connect and you are all set to go.Happy surfing using VPN
