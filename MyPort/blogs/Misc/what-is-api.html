              API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface</b>. Talking
              in technical terms, an API is a set of procedures,a computing
              interface , other points of access which an application, a
              library,third party software etc., makes available to programmers
              in order to allow it to interact with other software. If you
              didn’t get it, don't worry, neither did I initially &#128522; .
              Let’s explore what are API's in order to understand them better.
              <a

            </p>
            <h6>Egample scenario</h6>
            <p>
              Consider a hyptothetical scenario to understand better. Say Alex,
              goes to a book store. Assume he likes books written by a
              particular author.There are tons of book in the book store. Now
              imagine the amount of time and energy Alex would have to waste in
              searching the book in all the aisles of the bookstore.Now, here
              comes the bookstore employee, Diana. Diana can assist Alex. If he
              goes and asks Diana , she can help him find the book. <br />
            </p>
            <b>In this analogy </b><br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">1).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">Diana is the API for the Bookstores</p>
            <br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">2).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Bookstore can be a 3rd party app, or any other application which
              has the assets/data.This is the source of data for the API
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">3).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Alex is the software developer/end user or a 3rd party application
              which wants to use or say consume Bookstore's data
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">4).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              So Diana is like an intermediatory layer between Alex and the
              Bookstore.Any user can ask book of their choice and Diana can
              repond to the request accordingly.API is the same, it's an
              interface to any underlying asset.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6 style="display: inline">5).</h6>
            <p style="display: inline">
              Ofcourse you can put security etc to the API's so that not any
              random user can access data. Just like in our analogy Diana can
              ask Alex to prove his identity using Drivers License etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              Basically, API takes your requests and retrieve the response from
              the server. It’s the stuff that lets your products and services
              communicate or interact with other products and services without
              having to constantly build new connectivity infrastructure.If you
              are into computer science or IT industry, there is no escape from
              APIs.We all are connected through APIs. Nearly all businesses that
              use any kind of modern technology use APIs at some level to
              retrieve data or interact with a database for customers to use.
              <br /><br />Whenever you use an app on your phone or computer ,say
              you log onto Twitter or Facebook, you’re interacting with several
              different APIs behind the scenes.Or, say you’re planning to watch
              a movie in a theatre over the weekend, and logonto your favorite
              app to book the same. Then you type the "movie name", "dates",
              "number of seats" etc to check availability and click on "search"
              button.Then you see the movies nicely displayed on the UI with
              timings and other details.Behind the scenes, in all probability,
              there is some API sitting behind and retrieving the details for
              you based on the search details you entered.
            </p>
            <h4>How do APIs work?</h4>
            <p>
              So we already learnt above that an API- Application Programming
              Interface is a set of rules that define how computers,
              applications, or machines can talk to each other. You can think of
              it this way: the typical user interface is intended for use by a
              human being, while APIs are intended for use by an application or
              a computer or another software<br />
              <img
                src="apiandschema/api.jpeg"
                alt="api"
                class="img-fluid"
              /><br /><br />
              Most web APIs sit between the application and the web server. The
              human initiates an API call that tells the application to do
              something, then the application in turn will use an API to ask the
              web server to do something. The response returned by the web
              server is returned to the application which normally puts the
              details in a user friendly way i.e shown nicely on the front end
              so that the end user can read/understand <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Most Common Types of API</h4>
            <img
              src="apiandschema/soap_vs_rest.png"

            /><br /><br />
            <ul style="display: inline">

                <b>1 REST APIs)</b> - Stands for Representational State
                Transfer. <br />
                <img
                  src="apiandschema/restapi.jpg"
                  alt="api"

                /><br /><br />
                It is an architectural style. The
                <b>REST architecture</b> generally consists of clients, servers,
                resources, and a vocabulary of HTTP operations known as
                <b>request methods</b>. REST relies on principles that are
                ultimately simpler to follow than a prescribed protocol. Most of
                the API's specially Public API's use REST standard these days
                specifically because of its fast performance, reliability, and
                ability to scale by reusing modular components without affecting
                the system as a whole.<br />From developer point of view, REST
                is a set of rules that they need to follow when they create
                their API.<br />
                One of the rules states that you should be able to get a piece
                of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.<b
                  >Each URL</b
                >
                is called a <b>request</b> while the <b>data sent back</b> to
                you is called a <b>response</b>.<br />The <b>payload</b> - the
                data to be delivered (i.e the response) - will be
                <b>formatted in a language</b>
                such as <b>JSON</b>, or <b>XML</b>.<br />The
                <b>set of operations</b>
                are the methods available to HTTP, which is the underlying
                protocol for how browsers retrieve websites from servers. These
                methods include
                <b>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others</b>.<br />And thats why
                it's easier for developer because even if they don't know
                specifics of REST, they are likely to know how to work with
                RESTful APIs thanks to the underlying foundation upon which they
                are built: HTTP.<br /><br />
                <h5>The Anatomy Of A REST API Request</h5>
                <h6 style="display: inline">A).</h6>
                <p style="display: inline">
                  <b>URI (uniform resource identifier)</b>, which is the URL
                  address, also known as an “endpoint”).The endpoint (or route)
                  is the url you request for. It follows this structure:
                  https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/
                  https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/. The root-endpoint is
                  the starting point of the API you’re requesting from. The
                  root-endpoint of Github’s API is https://api.github.com while
                  the root-endpoint Twitter’s API is https://api.twitter.com.

                This is more complex than REST because it requires more
                information upfront about security and how to sends messages.
                SOAP, unlike the REST pattern, supports the XML data format only
                and strongly follows preset standards such as messaging
                structure, a set of encoding rules, and a convention for
                providing procedure requests and responses and therefore to lack
                the lightweight portability and flexibility of REST.SOAP was
                developed to help standardize message formats and requests.SOAP
                API's are still used specially it can assist in certain
                scenarios better. For instance, if you need more robust
                security, SOAP’s support for WS-Security can come in handy. SOAP
                can be extended with WS standard protocols. Another advantage of
                SOAP is that it offers built-in retry logic to compensate for
                failed communications. REST, on the other hand, doesn’t have a
                built-in messaging system. If a communication fails, the client
                has to deal with it by retrying. There’s also no standard set of
                rules for REST. SOAP is highly extensible through other
                protocols and technologies. In addition to WS-Security, SOAP
                supports WS-Addressing, WS-Coordination, WS-ReliableMessaging,
                and a lot of other web services standards. You can find full
