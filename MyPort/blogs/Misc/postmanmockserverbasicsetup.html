              In this blog we will learn about Postman mock server. Postman have
              this unique feature of mock servers that allow developers to
              <b>simulate an endpoint</b> without the need of actually spinning
              up a back-end server.Postman has now included a new feature to
              help you even further.This new feature allows you to set mock
              responses.This feature is called <b>Examples</b>. We will see how
              to use them below.
            </p>

                In most of the images I used below, I have marked
                <span style="color: red"><b>items in red</b></span> so that you
                can notice what am referring to more easily
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 1)</b> Open Postman App and <b> create a workspace</b>.I
                created
                <b>"mockserverdemo"</b>
                <img

                /><br /><br />
              </li>

              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 2)</b> Now that worksace is created lets
                <b>create a Mock Server </b>.Click on "New" on top left and then
                click <b>New Mock Server</b> as shown on image below(marked in
                red).
                <img
                  src="postmanmockserver/1CreateNewMockServer.PNG"

                />
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 3)</b> Imagine we are creating an Library Application
                and say, we need two api's namely <b>books</b> and
                <b>authors</b>. So lets create a 2 Endpoints for this
                collection. Also, adding sample JSON response we are expecting
                (assume api schema is already decided). Now, we have books and
                authors , two endpoints configured with predefined responses.
                Other thing to note is the response code configured for both the
                requests(200 for both)
                <img
                  src="postmanmockserver/2twoendpoints.PNG"
                  alt="twoendpoints"
                  class="img-fluid"
                /><br /><br />
                You can download both sample responses from my github link
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/manjusa/postmansamplecollection.git"
                >
                  Github link to sample responses </a
                >Files are named "<b>samplebooks"</b> and
                <b>"sampleauthors"</b>.
                <br />
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 4) </b>Name the mock server. I named it
                <b>librarymockserver</b>
                <img
                  src="postmanmockserver/3namems.PNG"
                  alt="mockservername"
                  class="img-fluid"
                />
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 5)</b> You will see collection is created with the same
                name as well. In this case "librarymockserver".Now that
                mockserver is setup,<b>copy the base url</b>. You will need it
                for all subsequent requests you want to make
                <img
                  src="postmanmockserver/4copybaseurl.PNG"
                  alt="mockservername"
                  class="img-fluid"
                />
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Info)</b> Before we move any further let's pause and
                understand
                <b>What are Examples and Why do we need them </b>.Like mentioned
                above, Example is a new feature introduced by Postman. It helps
                you bind a particular request with a response. i.e it creates
                tightly coupled request and response pair.
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b> Now to answer why we need Examples</b>. In a real world
                scenario a particular API will throw mutliple responses eg 200
                for OK,404 not found,500 etc etc. It's pretty useful if you
                create and save few example responses along side a request.This
                makes API more understandable,so your colleagues can get a quick
                overview of it by just looking at examples and they will
                definitely appreciate it :-). To take a step further, imagine
                you are going to build an api with an endpoint which doesnot yet
                exist, or your server just isn't ready. With <b>Egamples</b> you
                can mock raw responses and save them. Then you will be able to
                generate a mock endpoint for each of them using Postman’s mock
                service.With this setup, developers can makes requests to the
                mock endpoint, and get started with their front-end development
                work based on the mock response returned from the mock
                endpoint.This way front end devs can work paralelly along with
                backend devs,who in turn, may be actually writing the backend
                code. The whole process becomes streamlined, and this setup
                leads to get work done parallely and fast.
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b> If you look at Step 3 above</b>, while creating the mock
                server, first step was to <b>create a collection</b> and then
                give the <b>request path</b> , <b>response code</b> and a
                <b>response</b>. If you entered those values you already have
                created an Example(<b>named default</b>)
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 6) </b> Click on <b>books</b> on the left, and then
                click <b>Examples</b> on the right and select first eg
                <b> i.e default. </b>
                <img

              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 7)</b> Clicking on <b>default</b> should open below.
                There are few points to consider in below image. As usual, I
                have marked
                <span style="color: red"><b>them in red</b></span> so that you
                can notice it
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    There is variable used for base url i.e named
                    <b>url</b>. Variable is created for us automatically and
                    setup in environment scope when we were creating mock
                    server.Refer <b>step 4</b>. Remember, you need to have an
                    environment setup otherwise this variable can't be used. If
                    you need to understand various scope do watch my youtube
                    video below to get better understanding.But please hold on
                    watching until you finish this blog :-)

                    In the <b>example response</b> select <b>body</b> and ensure

                <b>Info) </b> Also, assume that you also want to configure books
                with a <b>500 response</b> .This is required if you want your
                API throw an exception. This would mimic an unexpected exception
                and the front end developers can write code to handle it
                properly and gracefully.
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 8)</b> Let's create an Example for 500 error.I will call

                did on step 6 and then click on <b>Add Exampl</b>e on the
                right.Clicking that will open up a window.Enter the details

                <b>Step 9)</b> Now you have 2 Examples configured.books_200 and
                books_500.I had no envorinment setup so I will have to copy the
                base url to replace the variable {{url}} Incase you don't have
                the mock url copied anywhere, you can get it by clicking your
                mockserver. Image for reference below

              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Step 10) </b>Now let's actually create a mock request so that
                we match one of the saved examples. Let's create the mock
                request so that we get response set in <b>books_200 Example</b>.
                Important part is setting <b>x-mock-response-code</b> as
                <b>200 in the request header</b> as shown below.Click on "send"
                and you will get response as expected which was set in books_200
                example.

                  class="img-fluid"
                /><br /><br />
                Same way if you set <b>x-mock-response-code</b> as
                <b>500 in the request header</b> then you will get
                <b>error we configured</b>(book_500). Isn't this feature handy
                :-)

              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Info)</b> In above example mock request, we used
                x-mock-response-code to retrieve the saved example

              To get the <b>x-mock-response-id</b> or in that matter even
              <b>x-mock-response-name</b> you need to make certain Postman API

              How the incoming mock request matches one of the saved Egample
            </h6>
            <p>
              Postman uses it's own algorithm. I have put the link to their
              official website in "Official Documenation" section below. But i
              will explain the algorithm in simpler way but not in as detail as
              Postman ofcourse.
            </p>
            <ul style="display: inline">
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots" style="margin-top: -2%">
                <b>Properly formatted responses</b>- Responses that are not in
                matching format are removed from the matching process
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>HTTP method</b>- Pretty obvious. Any responses that are not
                the same as HTTP method type are removed from the matching
                process.For eg, if your mock request sent to , like say you do a
                <b>POST</b> to http/{baseurl}/books then all saved egamples
                whose method type is not POST will be removed. Therefore, as per
                my saved Examples,nothing will be matched because I had no POST
                for books at all.I only had <b>books_200</b> and
                <b>books_500</b> configured both of which were only GETs
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Filter by URL</b> I will not dwelve into it but will
                touchbase on it with an eg. I have created a separate blog for
                the same. Afterall we just need to get our work done and not
                masterize the algorithm in most cases. Link to the blog in
                "Learn More" section below
              </li>
              <li class="liStyleWithoutDots">
                <b>Wildcards</b> If you donot have the variable configured in
                the mock server's associated environment,then those variables
                are treated as <b>Wildcards</b>. Again, I will explain that in a
                separate blog.Link to the blog in "Learn More" section below
