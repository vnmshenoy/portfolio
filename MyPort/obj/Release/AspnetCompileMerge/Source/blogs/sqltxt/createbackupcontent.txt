                            </li>
                            <li>Now you are at the <b>"Back Up Database Screen"</b>.There are quite a few number of options here like you can choose database Backup Type as Full or Differential etc.For our eg, we will keep it as "Full". 

                            In the "Destination" option Select <b>"Back up to"</b> as <b>"Disk" </b>(place where back up file will be stored).You can click "Add" and then enter path of your choice. See below image <br><br>
                            <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/5backupTo.PNG" alt="add backup file"  /> 
                            <br><br>
							You will see a prompt and enter the file location and the file name and append it with ".bak". I entered my local disk's <b>C$</b> and called it <b>"backup.bak"</b>
                            Then click on OK on <b>"Select Backup Destination"</b> prompt
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that above path we gave to save our backup file has proper read/write access for SQL Services
                            </li>
                            <li>Press OK on the 'Back Up Database' window and the database will begin backing up
                            </li>
                             <li>You will see a progress bar and when backup is completed, SSMS will notify you thorugh a prompt saying <b>'The backup of database [YouDBNAME]  completed successfully'</b></li>
                             <li>Go to the saved directory and you should see the backup file (in my case <b> backup.bak </b>)</li>                            
                        </ul>                        
                        <p class="pstyle">Congratulations... :-) you have created a back up file </p>
