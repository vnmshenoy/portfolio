                       <b>What is a QR Code</b>
                        <p> QR code stands for <b>Quick Response code</b>.Many of you might have not heard about QRCode but would have used it for sure in one or other way.
                            
                            What better than an image?<insert image here></insert>
                            sample image
                            If you take a look at the image of the business card above, you'll notice that on the left-hand side of the card, there is a strange graphic consisting of black squares and dots. This, essentially, is what a QR code looks like.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
                        QRCode  is a two dimensional barcode that stores information in black and white dots (called data pixels or “QR code modules”).  To make your QR code even better, you can also get a QR code with logo.
                        The idea behind a QR code is to create an image and this image can be scanned  quickly (hence the name) by any modern day Smartphone.All you need to do is install  a qr reader application from playstore or Apple App Store.Once you scan through this application, the qr image gets translated into something more meaningful.Like in the sample image above it has url of my website
                            I have taken a screenshot from my phone of the above qrcode
                            <insert image here></insert>
                        </p><p>
                        a simple way to generate and read QR code 
                        A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached.
                        A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera,
                        Typically, a smartphone is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser)

                        advantages for qrcode
                        The main advantage of a QR code is its versatility. QR codes can be used for anything and everything. They are also beneficial for both customers and businesses. For example, a business saves money and advertising costs by distributing a QR code to their website or URL.

                        code in order to help in the manufacturing process, they aided in tracking vehicles and parts. It was designed to allow for fast decoding speeds, hence the name Quick Response code. QR codes owe their existence to the development and success of barcodes. Since their creation barcodes became very popular due to the speed at which they could be scanned, the accuracy they provided, and their multiple functionalities. With increased popularity, and proper recognition of the convenience associated with barcodes, demand for barcodes that could store more information, had more variation, and would take up a smaller printing area continuously grew.	</p>

                        Even if you've never heard of a QR code, chances are that you're already subconsciously familiar with them. QR codes are used throughout a range of different marketing materials these days and over the last few years, they've become more common than ever.
                        If you take a look at the image of the business card above, you'll notice that on the left-hand side of the card, there is a strange graphic consisting of black squares and dots. This, essentially, is what a QR code looks like.
                        The idea behind a QR code is to create an image that can be scanned by any modern day Smartphone (with a QR code reader application) and translated into something more meaningful. QR codes are often used to contain web address information and links, but they can be used to direct Smartphone users to a multitude of other media too (e.g. videos, images etc).
                        Obviously, that's all well and good, but what actually is the point of a QR code? Surely you can just type in a web address on your phone and visit the website that way? While that may be true, the point of a QR code is to simplify the process. Smartphone (or tablet PC) keyboards are tricky compared to desktop/laptop keyboards and most of the time, people simply can't be bothered to type in website addresses on their Smartphone.

                        A QR code is used by marketers to simplify the process and therefore, entice more people into visiting a website or a piece of content. This is why marketers regularly place QR codes on banners, business cards, flyers, leaflets, posters and so forth.
                        Basically, a QR code works in the same way as a barcode at the supermarket. It is a machine-scannable image that can instantly be read using a Smartphone camera. Every QR code consists of a number of black squares and dots which represent certain pieces of information. When your Smartphone scans this code, it translate that information into something that can be easily understand by humans.
                        uite simply, a QR code is an encoded piece of data. The data in a QR code can be alphanumeric, numeric, binary or Kanji (Kanji is a form of Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese writing system)

                        Although that is the technical explanation of how a QR code works, something much more important to focus on is the fact that QR codes can be scanned at the touch of a button by the hundreds of millions of people around the world that use a Smartphone on a daily basis. This makes them great for marketers.

                        <ul style="padding-left:0px"><b> Below are the steps one should follow</b>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Buy a router that supports <b>OpenVPN</b>. You can buy it online and there are many options available. I bought online from Amazon.All you need to ensure before buying is that it supports OpenVPN.</li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Power on the router. Pretty basic but should not be missed &#128522; </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Your ISP-Internet Service Provider might have provided you with a Wi-Fi-modem. My ISP's network had SSID of say BELONG-XXXX. This was the network i used to connect to so far to connect to internet(without VPN) This Wi-Fi modem shall have an Ethernet LAN port that can be used to connect to the router’s (the one you bought) WAN port . You can connect your ISP's modem to router by cable directly</li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Now its time to connect your device(windows,android,ios etc) to the router. You can connect to the router via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi.I connected through Wi-Fi (Am sure connecting through LAN will be equally simple as well) Doing so only connects your devices to the local area network (LAN) of the router. You cannot access the Internet currently
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Once connected to the router,you can search for the <b>SSID </b> of the router(must be provided in the router’s documentation). My router's SSID started with GL-XXXXX-XXX . To access the Web Admin panel I had to visit <b>http://192.168.8.1</b> Once logged in, you can view the rotuer's Web Admin panel. Once connected, you can login to the web-based interface of the router.Once you succesfully log in, you will see the daashboard.I have added mine for reference only.Yours may look different obviously.
                                <img src="../../img/openVPN/1img.PNG" alt="Router Web Based Interface" />
                                <b>Note:</b> Look for the URL, Userid and the Password in the router’s documentation itself
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Web Admin panel allows you to check the status and manage the settings of the router.Once in the admin panel, configure your router to access the internet so that it can talk to the outside world. To do so,I clicked on the <b>“repeater”</b> settings of the router. It takes an existing signal from a wireless router or wireless access poin and rebroadcasts it to create a second network. In Repeater section, click <b>Scan</b> to search for the available wireless networks nearby (in my case the original wireless network with SSID BELONG-XXX).Connect using user ISP’s username and password
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Doing above would ensure that your router is communicating with outside world and you connect to the Internet even if you are connecting to the SSID of the router
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            So far we have configured router to connect to existing Wi-Fi network.We havenot setup VPN yet. Now lets look how to setup vpn.All major VPN providers like ExpressVPN ,Cyberghost,Surfshark etc allow you to download <b>manual configuration</b> Download the <b>.ovpn file</b> from the manual configuration page of your VPN provider. Each Server location (in my case as I was trying to connect to <b>India-Mumbai</b>) had an .ovpn file download option. Download the file to your Deskptop and save it.
                            <b>Note:</b> I have used both ExpressVPN and Surfshark and the process is more or less same.Am sure it is similar with other VPN providers as well.I in this case will use Surfshark just because I have that currently but that doesn’t stop you from using your favorite VPN provider.
                        </p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:0px"><b>Steps to follow on VPN provider's website </b>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Buy a subscription. Most of them offer a trial period of 30 days or so which is excellent option to try out</li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">I am taking an eg of SurfShark.Navigate to surfshark’s website <b>https://support.surfshark.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001458953-Tutorial</b> This link is available at the time of download.Basically you need to search how to setup manual configuration irrespective of which provider you are using </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Since am using Windows laptop i follow the steps to download .opvn file for windows device.I downloaded both <b>.tcpovpn</b> and <b>.udpovpn</b> files 

                                UDP and TCP are protocols with their own pros and cons.I wont get into depth of it but I would say The OpenVPN UDP protocol is usually a little bit faster, while OpenVPN TCP is usually a little bit more stable.However, that is not always the case, therefore, we always suggest trying them both out and checking what works best for you.

                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Once you have downloaded this .opvn file, you will also have to copy paste service credential from surfsharks website as shown in img 4 below.Save these somewhere as you will need it soon 
                                <img src="../../img/openVPN/4img.PNG" alt="VPN Service Credentials" />
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <ul style="padding-left:0px"><b> Now go back to the routers admin panel for final steps </b>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Look for <b>OpenVpn Client</b>. My router’s webadmin had below settings as shown in img 2
                                <img src="../../img/openVPN/2img.PNG" alt="VPN Service Credentials" />
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Click on the OpenVPN client and you will see a page which asks you to add .ovpn file something like in img 3
                                <img src="../../img/openVPN/3img.PNG" alt="VPN Service Credentials" />
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Drop the .ovpn file you saved on your machine(the file you saved on desktop in our earlier steps).It will ask for name(eg mumbai_myvpnserver1) just for you to identify the server location quickly. It will also ask for server's username and password).Copy paste the username and password your got from your vpn providers website(in this case surfshark)
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-left:30px">Click connect and you are all set to go.Happy surfing using VPN
                            </li>
