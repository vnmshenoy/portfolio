                            <li>Login to the Server using steps we saw earlier(Use Windows authentication)</li>
                            <li>Expand the server, expand Databases, select the database you want to take back up of.Right Click on the database </li>

                                <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/4backup.PNG" alt="db backup" /> 
                            </li>
                            <li>Now you are at the "Back Up Database Screen".There are quite a few number of options here like you can choose database Backup Type as Full or Differential etc.For our eg, we will keep it as "Full". 

                            In the "Destination" option Select "Back up to" as “Disk”(place where back up file will be stored).You can click “Add” and then enter path of your choice. See below image

                                 lt="add backup file"  /> 
                            <br>You will see a prompt and enter the file location and the file name and append it with ".bak". I entered my local disk's <b>C$</b> and called it <b>"backup.bak"</b>
                            Then click on OK on "Select Backup Destination " prompt
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that above path we gave to save our backup file has proper read/write access for SQL Services
                            </li>
                            <li>Press OK on the "Back Up Database" window and the database will begin backing up
                            </li>
                             <li>You will see a progress bar and when backup is completed, SSMS will notify you thorugh a prompt saying 'The backup of database [YouDBNAME]  completed successfully'   </li>
                             <li>Go to the saved directory and you should see the backup file (in my case backup.bak)   </li>                            
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Congratulations... :-) you have created a back up file </p>
