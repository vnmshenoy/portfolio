 <h1 class="mt-4 h1-tutorial">Database Setup</h1>
                        <p>Assuming that you have installed SQL Server Manamgent Studio(SSMS) from the official Microsoft Website, lets look at the steps to get you started</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Launch SQL Server Management Studio</li>
                            <li>Used windows authentication and connected to the SQL Server Database Engine as shown below
                                <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/1connectToDbEngine.PNG" alt="connect to db" />
                            </li>
                            <ul>Creating a new Database
                                <li>Rt click on the "databases" and click on “New Database” as shown in  img below 
                                    <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/2CreateAnewDB.PNG" alt="create new db" /> 
                                </li>
                                <li>Name the database whatever you want as shown in  img below.I named it "TestingDB"
                                    <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/2aNameOfDB.PNG" alt="name db" /> 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>You can create a new query as shown in img below.Ensure that you select the database on left and then click on "New Query" to ensure that your query runs against the correct database <img style="width:60%;height:40%" src="../../img/sqlforBeginners/3aSelectOnNewQueryWithDBSelected.PNG" alt="select query" /> </li>
                            <li>Lets create few tables and data and get the ball rolling.I have shared the model and the data scripts in the github project
                                <a href="https://github.com/manjusa/SqlBeginners.git">Link to the github files which has model and data for db</a></li>
                            <li>After you have downloaded the files,just create a new query and first run "model.sql" which would create the tables and then run "data.sql" which would insert dummy records into the database tables</li>
                            <li>Above ensure that you have the correct name of the database on the first line </li>
                            <li>After running above steps,you should see the content in the database</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Wohooo... now as we have data in the tables we can start writing queries on our database</p>
                        <br>
